## Description: 

For our final team project, we decided to build a fully functioning web site for a completely new business that we created. This project is intended to showcase our newly acquired skills as Full Stack Web Developers as well as highlight our entrepreneurial spirits. Our business model is simple. **Book online. Pay upfront. Call us because you want to, not because you need to.**

## Facts: 

## In Oregon there are:
- 725 Wineries
- 261 Breweries
- 660 Dispensaries

    
## Business 
    
We think there is a very real market for this business and after everyone spending so much time in quarantine and isolation, by the time things open back up again in 6, 9, 18 months, this business should be able to get up and running very quickly and start thriving immediately.

So you’re probably wondering why is all of this important? It’s important because the business we’ve created involves getting people to and from all of these locations throughout the state of Oregon. Ladies and gentlemen, may we present, Reds Gold and Greens Tours!

Yes, by now you’ve figured out that the name relates directly to wineries, breweries, and dispensaries. Our business model is simple with upfront pricing. We get you and your party on the road and into your favorite places, quickly and easily. We take care of the travel so you can focus on your party. 

Most limo and party bus companies have tons of hidden fees, special rules, and involves customers getting on the phone to work out all the details. The site and the business that we’ve created eliminates all of those issues. *Book online, pay upfront, call us if you want to, not because you need to!*
